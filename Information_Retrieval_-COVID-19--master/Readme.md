Introduction and Motivation:

COVID-19 has resulted in an explosion of online questions related to the pandemic. While there is a rich collection of content on the web in the form of publications and articles, medical researchers would like to home in on the most relevant pieces of text in conjunction with their scope of research. Traditional search engines do a limited job in this context but generating a set of most relevant outputs through pieces of texts and the publications they come from as answers to queries would even further speed up the process of gathering data most pertinent to the interests of the researcher. We intend to answer the following question through this project:
1. What are the underlying topics within the medical case report in relation to COVID-19?
2. What are the similarities and dissimilarities between COVID-19 and the earlier pandemics?
3. How to speed up the pace of medical research and find relevant research publications without browsing all the existing publications for successful collaboration and innovation?

Proposed Research Designs and Evaluation Techniques:

Stage 1: Data Assimilation and Understanding the Requirements

Stage 2: Data Pre-Processing & Cleaning

Stage 3: Feature Engineering and manipulations

Stage 4: Similarity Implementation: BERT and Clinical BERT

Stage 5: Model Evaluations and Improvement

Stage 6: Prediction Tool Deployment


Data Description:
CORD-19 by Allen AI is a resource of over 300,000 scholarly articles.
Total Rows: 318137
Columns:
paper_id, title, Abstract, authors, body_text
Data Set link: https://allenai.org/data/cord-19


Evaluation Metrics:

• Compute semantic similarity scores
• Compare and list the best scores based on a sentence level query
• Comparing Clinical Bert, Bert models with other standard techniques such as cosine similarity and BLEU
• Selecting model with best results based on prediction accuracy
• Research on other evaluation metrics to judge performance measure of information retrieval methodology

Appendix: The outputs will be the Top 10 Articles most similar to the Query. Intended output:


Future Scope:

• Group articles based on research design – like – clinical trials, observational studies etc
• Organize content for the information retrieval into categories
• Leverage the LitCovid Data Set to validate the categories
